More severe side effects include (uncommon):
- Severe stinging, burning, itching, or soreness where the medicine is applied
	- We recommend refrigerating a portion of the topical prior to use. We do not recommend refrigerating the whole tube of medication as prolonged storage in cool/cold temperatures will reduce its efficacy
- Swollen glands
- Redness or crusting around your hair follicles
- Signs of a skin infection (redness, swelling, itching, oozing)

Less serious side effects amy include (common):
- Mild burning, stinging, or itching
- Skin redness
- Acne
- Cold or flu-like symptoms, such as stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat
- Headache
- Feelign more sensitive to hot or cold temperatures.

The evidence in the medical literature shows that there is minimal systemic absorption of the medication in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (even if applied to multiple areas of the body), as the vast majority of studies show that blood levels are less than 1mg/mL (undetectable). Furthermore, as skin barrier function improves, absorption of tacrolimus ointment across the skin decreases.

The FDA has issued a public health advisory to inform healthcare professionals and patients about a potential cancer risk from use of Elidel (pimecrolimus) and Protopic (tacrolimus). Thsi concern is based on information from animal studies, case reports in a small number of patients, and knowledge of how drugs in this class work. Extensive safety data have been a analyzed from thousands of patients in clinical trials using tacrolimus ointment. To date, there is no evidence to suggest that there is an increased risk of lymphoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer in adults or children using tacrolumus ointment. Although there is a theoretical increased risk of infection in patients using Protopic, the chance of a bacterial or viral skin infection in patients iwht eczema using tacrolimus ointment appears to be the same as for control patients iwht eczema.
