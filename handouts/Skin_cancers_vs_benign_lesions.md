## Common Skin Cancers

**Non-melanomas**
"Nonmelanoma skin cancer" refers to the type of skin cancer that are _not_ melanoma. These include kartinocyte carcinomas, such as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas - the most common types. Less common variants include sebaceous carcinoma, merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphoma, and dermatofibrosacoma protuberans. These cancers are derived from skin cells that are not the pigment-producing cells (melanocyte). While keratinocyte carcinomas are predominantly UV-related, linked to chronic UV exposure or severe UV-burns, the etiology of others are unclear. Nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer. Superficial types can be "scraped and burned" off or treated with a topical cream. Invasive and other types need to be excised.

**Melanomas**
Melanoma is a less common type of skin cancer, but is more aggressive and likely to grow quickly, spread and cause death. A melanoma is derived from the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin 00 the igment that gives your skin its color; melanocytes are also found in the eyes and some internal organs such as intestines. UV radiation, such as sunlight, appears to be a major cause, but the exact cause of some melanomas is unclear. Most often, melanomas are excised; the margins of "normal skin" and whether lymph nodes need to be sampled depend on the depth of invasino and other features from the biopsy. Sometimes, however, chemotherapy and immunotherapy are required for more aggressive melanomas.

Regularly examine your skin for the following:
* An open sore that bleeds, oozes or crusts and remains open for a few weeks, only to heal up and then bleed again.
* A persistent, scaly red patch or lesion that sometimes crusts or bleeds.
* An elevated growth - eg, with a central depression, warty features - that bleeds.
* A rapidly growing lesion
* A pigmented lesion that is changing in color, such as darkening, losing pigment, or changing in shape

## Common Benign Lesions

**Seborrheic Keratoses**
A seborrheic keratosis is a harmless waxy, crubmly or warty spot that appears during adult life. As time goes by, seborrheic keratoses become more numerous. Some poeple inherit a tendency to devleop a very large number of them. Others follow sunburn or severe rash; are associated with frition; arise with certain anticancer medications; but the exact cause is unknown. They are commonly treated by freezing or "burning" them off with specific medications or electrocautery in the office.

**Cherry Angiomas**
A cherry angioma is a harmless red or purple spot that arises from blood vessels. They develop in adults, usually after the age of 40. They can occur anywhere on the skin, including the lips. They can be treated by freezing or "burning" them off with electrocautery or a laser in the office.

**Lentigo/Lentigines**
A pigmented flat or slightly raised lesion with a clearly defined edge; in contrast, a freckle/ephelis does not fade in the winter months. THey can be solitary but are more often in multiples. Most commonly, they are caused by UV radiatino and have a propensity for sun-exposed areas. There are several types:
* lentigo simplex - childhood
* solar lentigo - adult onset, sun-exposed areas
* melanotic macule - lips, genitalia

Unless they have suspicious features, they are observed. Cosmetic treatment options include sun retinoids, cryotherapy or laser therapy.
