## **"Precancer"?**
**Sun-Damage Skin...**
People with sun damage are at risk for actinic keratoses and developing actinic cheilitis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC, which is more common than SCC), melanoma and rare forms of skin cancer such as Merkel cell carcinoma.

**... with a risk**
The main concern about actinic keratoses is that they predispose the patient to squamous cell carcinoma. However, it is rare for a solitary actinic keratosis to evolve to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but the risk of SCC occuring at some stage in a patient with more than 10 actinic keratoses is thought to be about 10-15%.

**How do I identify an actinic keratosis?**
An actinic keratosis is a scaly spot found on sun-damaged skin. Actinic keratosis may be solitary but there are often multiple keratoses. The appearance varies.

* A flat or thickened papuleor plaque
* White or yellow; scaly, warty or horny surface
* Skin colored, red or pigmented
* Tender or asymptomatic

Actinic keratoses are very common on sites repeatedly exposed to the sun, especially the backs of the hands and the face, most often affecting the ears, nose, cheeks, upper lip, vermilion of the loewr lip, temples, forehead and balding scalp. In severely chronically sun damaged individuals, they may also be found on the upper trunk, upper and lower limps, and dorsum of feet.

## **Treatment Options**

Actinic keratoses are usually removed because they are unsightlyor uncomfortable, or because of the risk that skin cancer may develop in them.
Treatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells.

**To Treat of Not to Treat**
Tender, thickened, ulcerated or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. _Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation._

**Treatment Options**
Cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen
Shave, curettage (Scraping with a sharp instrument) and electrocautery (burning) may be necessary to remove a cutaneous horn or hypertrophic actinic keratosis.
Field treatments with the following:
* Diclofenac (NSAID) gel twice daily for 3 months
* 5-Fluorouracil (chemotherapy) cream applied once or twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks
* Imiquimode cream (immune respose modifier) applied daily for 2-4 weeks
* Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves applying a photosensitizer (a porphyrin chemical such as methyl aminolevulanic acid) to the affected area prior to exposing it to a source of visible light

**Outlook with Treatment**
_Actinic keratoses may recur months or years after treatment._ The same treatment can be repeated or another method used. Patients who have been treated for actinic keratoses are at risk of developing new actinic keratoses _and_ all skin cancers.
