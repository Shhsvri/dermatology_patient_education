These are a few notes which can be very helpful to people struggling with dermatitis (or eczema).

The (hypoallergenic) skin prouct "diet" on this handout outlines products which I have included because they do not contain any of the most common ingredients that can be a cause of contact induced eczema or dermatitis. This list is small and limited, especially regarding shampoos. The list is based on the North American Contact Dermatitis group (NACDG) bi-annual published data of the frequency of contact allergen positive patch test results in North America, and my experience as an NACDG member. This is also based on my experience interviewing and testing many patients with eczema (dermatitis), time reviewing labels of products and learning about the importance of allergy.

These allergens are well documented and reported in the medical literature as the most common sources of contact type allergy. Some of the itemseliminated are truly uncommon sources of allergy, though among patients with dermatitis, or eczema, they are among the chemicals to which a person may be allergic. This skin diet does not elimiate all contact allergens, but it does a good job of eliminating the ones most commonly identified. I have used the American Contact Dermatitis Society CAMP (Contact Allergen Management Program) database to check and eliminate these ingredients. Label reading is also helpful if you have known allergy, because ingredients in products can change, even for packages which look the same on the front.

Just because a product like a lotion or cream states on the label "hypoallergenic" it does not mean that such a product can't cause allergy. Even some ingredients considered hypoallergenic (or less apt to cause allergy) by the manufacturer will in some individuals, be a source of allergy. Most of the products can be found in a typical drug store chain; if you cannot locate a product, search for it online.

**Even using a product which does contain a ingredient to which you area unknowingly allergic can worsen or aggravate your skin problem, and keep it giong another several weeks. Therefore, only STRICT adherence to teh "skin diet", using only th eproducts on the list if needed, will be likely to help resolve your problem if allergy is a cause or important aggravating factor.**

Testing for allergy is possible with patch testing. Patch testing may be recommended by your doctor to further evaluate the cause of your rash.

For these recommendations to be successful you should:

1. **Use only those products on the list that you feel you need, unless otherwise advised by your doctor**
2. **Limit your use of skin products.** If a moisturizer is needed, the thicker one is better. The most effective moisturizer feels greasy and is messy. If this is unacceptable, choose a product recommended in the cream or lotion category. Some people find using a greasy product at night, and a lotion or cream during the day is most acceptable.
3. If you are prescribed a medication, use your medication as advised by your doctor. Rub it in well. It is best to apply it at least one time a day after your skin has absorbed some water from bathing. Pat dry after bath or shower and apply your medication.
4. Follow-up with your doctor if your skin problem fails to resolve or improve.
