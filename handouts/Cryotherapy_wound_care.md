# What is "cryotherapy"?

Cryotherapy is the treatment of a surface skin lesion with a freezing agent, such as liquid nitrogen. Such lesions include actinic keratosis, warts, seborrheic keratosis, lentigo, and, sometimes, superficial basal cell carcinomas or squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

The treatment is applied to the skin lesion and sometimes around it. The duration of treatment determines the depth of damage. Sometimes, lesions are treated more than once in one visit to ensure adequate damage.

It may take seeral treatments for successful treatment, but most often the lesion resolves on the first treatment. Larger or thicker lesions or lesions on cosmetically sensitive areas may take several treatments to resolve.

## Risks
*Infection*

Thick, white or yellow draining discharge from the wound with pain or tenderness, localized swelling, or redness/heat. Other features include abnormal smell coming from the wound or friable, bleeding tissue despite appropriate care and management.

Delayed healing and ulceration
Permanent hypopigmentatino or scar
Persistent or recurrent lesions
Pain usually resolves within seconds or a day

## What to expect...

**Immediate cold, burning pain** followed by **redness** and possible swelling immediately or over a few hours.

The treated area may blister within a few hours to a few days, depending on the depth and duration of treatment; sometimes, the blister may contain a clear (serous) or red (bloody) fluid (this is harmless).

In a few days to a few weeks, **crust, scale or a scab develops over the wound** and may last for a few weeks before falling off. Sometimes, such as the leg, the scab may take a few months to fall off. **Redness may last few weeks.**

**If no resolution in 21 days**, call to make an appointment; the actual appointment can wait a few more weeks as the lesion may still resolve.

## Wound Care

**When the crust, scale or a scab develops**

- apply vaseline to the site several times a day to keep moist
- avoid picking at the scab
- sun protection after it heals
If a blister develops,
- keep the blister intact and allow it to rupture and scab
- however, if pain is severe, rupture but do not remove the blister top

Tylenol or ibuprofen may help reduce moderate to severe pain

*You may get the site wet and go about your normal daily activities*
